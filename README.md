#Numerical-Parallel-Coursework

## Part 1

All objects should move freely through space. Ensure that the global statistics
(minimal distance between all objects and maximum velocity) are still computed correctly.
Marks are given for correctness and efficiency (try to spot redundant computations) `[25]`

Run `solution-step1.py`.

## Part 2

Objects should merge on colliding. Code should terminate at the very moment when there's
only one object left. The position of this last object should be output as `x, y, z`. Write
a report on your approach and results. `[50]`
